Thank you for downloading Samstyle PHP Framework. We hope that you will
like using this framework as much as we do.

To start off, you will need to do a little configuration. Proceed to "inc/config.inc.php".

In the $_SITE array variable, you can change your application name, version, copyright,
URL root, enable GZIP or not.  Configure them as much as you want.

Note that modifying the $_PAGE array variable will affect all your pages that are viewed
on the browser.

In order for "dao/settings.dao.php" and MySQL connection to work, you need to first
configure the connection information at "config.inc.php". Then, restore the "dbapp.sql"
file. The "dbapp.sql" file will create a schema/database called "dbapp" with a table
named "settings".

This Framework is tested with Simple Test unit testing.
