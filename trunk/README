Thank you for downloading Samstyle PHP Framework. We hope that you'd like this framework as much as we do.

To start off, you will need to do a little configuration. Proceed to "inc/config.inc.php".

In the $_SITE array variable, you can change your application name, version, copyright, URL root, enable GZIP or not.  Configure them as much as you want.

Note that modifying the $_PAGE array variable will affect all your pages that are viewed on the browser.
