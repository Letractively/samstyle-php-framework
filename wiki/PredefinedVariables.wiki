#summary List of predefined variables in Samstyle PHP Framework
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

Samstyle PHP Framework creates some variables which are loaded at `head.inc.php` and can be used throughout the whole script. However, these variables are not superglobal and thus using `global` or `g()` to call these variables is still required.


= Predefined Variables =

  * `config.inc.php`
    * [PredefinedVariables_SITE `$_SITE`] - contains information about the website
    * [PredefinedVariables_PAGE `$_PAGE`] - contains information about the page
    * [PredefinedVariables_CONF `$_CONF`] - contains configuration information for add ons and so on.
    * [PredefinedVariables_includes `$includes`] - all files that are included (dao, classes, includes)

  * `head.inc.php`
    * `$session_hash` - a CRC32 hash of the session ID, can be used for form security validation
    * `$post` - all post headers. if `$_SITE['autoparsehttpargs']` is set to true, all post headers will be parsed with `parse_http_args()`
    * `$get` - all get headers.  if `$_SITE['autoparsehttpargs']` is set to true, all post headers will be parsed with `parse_http_args()`
