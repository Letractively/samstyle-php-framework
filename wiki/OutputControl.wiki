#summary Documentation on Output Control

= Introduction =

Generic PHP code output functions/statement are:
`echo`, `print` and so on

In Samstyle PHP Framework, the one and only function is `p()`.

= Purpose of `p()` =
The `p()` function was inspired by the use of `$(id)` instead of document.getElementById(id) in Javascript. Shortening names commonly used statement can lessen the developer's load.

Secondly, `p()` saves the output content into a buffer variable called `$_PAGE['content']` (see [PredefinedVariables_PAGE]), where later parsed with template tags into `$_PAGE['buffer']`. Then lastly using 1 real echo to write to client. Buffering output content into a variable has [http://thephpcode.blogspot.com/2009/06/echo-vs-output-buffer.html proven to speed up applications].

= Usage of `p()` = 

`p()`, like echo or print, accepts multiple parameters.<br/>The usual way is to call it like:
{{{
  p('This is shown to the client browser.');
}}}
Using multiple parameters:
{{{
  p('This is shown to', ' ', 'the client browser.');
}}}
It's most powerful when used with the HTML class:
{{{
  p(html::css($CssCode));
  // outputs <style type="text/css"><!-- ... --></style>
}}}
Also, you can debug elegantly with:
{{{
  p(php::dump($var));
  // outputs <pre>array(0){}</pre>
  // and formats nicely on the browser.
}}}

With `p()` you will also be able to use [CustomHTMLTags Customized HTML tags].
